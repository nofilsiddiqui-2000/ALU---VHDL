# Arithmetic Unit Design in Structural VHDL

## Project Overview
This project implements an **Arithmetic Unit** capable of performing the following calculation:



- **A** and **B** are 8-bit unsigned inputs.
- **P** is a 16-bit unsigned output.

The design includes internal registers for inputs and output, status signals, and an active-low reset functionality. It has been modeled using **structural VHDL**, with a focus on modularity, synthesis, and simulation.

## Features
1. **Structural VHDL Design**: The circuit is implemented with clearly defined structural components for easy synthesis and simulation.
2. **Multiplier Choice**: The design incorporates a carefully chosen multiplier (e.g., Array Multiplier or Booth Multiplier) for efficient computation.
3. **Testbench**: Comprehensive testbench included to validate all functionality and edge cases.
4. **Generic Design**: Supports simulation and synthesis for variable input sizes.
5. **Enhanced Functionality**: The unit is capable of extended operations such as:
   - Handling signed inputs (A, B, and P).
   - Using additional 8-bit inputs (C and D) to compute:
     ```
     P = (A * B) / (2 * C) + D
     ```
6. **Serial I/O**: Reduces the I/O count with serial inputs and outputs, incorporating control signals.
7. **Optimized Performance**: Designed to minimize FPGA resource utilization while maintaining speed.
